My first R Markdown File
================================

This is my first R Markdown file so please be patient

Here, we are going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's make a pairs chart of the airquality data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiaion and temperature
```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```
